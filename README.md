Yet Another Modular CAMera

## Because why not

I wanted to try out 6x9 but didn't have any camera shooting that format.
I did have a couple Mamiya press lenses and a Fujinon 4x5 135mm, so I thought "why not build one?!"

## Main Components (cf. /dist)

* Body (6x12 variant)
* Lens cone (127,6mm flange focal distance)
* 6x6 body insert
* 6x6 Magazone light trap inserts
* Grip(s)
* Sport finder!

## Parts list

* Screws
* Threaded inserts
